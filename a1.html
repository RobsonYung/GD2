        <h2>A1: CONFOUNDING TOOLS</h2> 

        :design a 24” × 36” digital poster about my life during COVID 19. The rule is that it must not be made by existing design software.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3>Idea</h3></button>
        <div class="content">
            <h4>Class 1</h4>
            <p>My idea is to use Spotify, which was one of my most frequently-used apps during Covid, as the main component of my poster. I decided to deliver my message in the most direct way which is with texts. So, I planned to combine some song names to form a sentence that describes my life under the pandemic.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3>Process Work</h3></button>
        <div class="content">
            <h4>Class 1</h4>
            <p>I used some random songs to try out the idea of forming a sentence using song names. I have also decided to use Google Slide as my design tool to compose my poster.</p>

            <hr color="black" style="margin-left:87vh">

            <h4>Class 2</h4>
            <p>I thought of a sentence to describe my life during Covid 19: Hi everyone, one fun fact about me is that I don’t even know where my school at. For the next step, I searched for the songs with names that can fit in my sentence and tried different layouts. I have also added some album covers that contain Covid-related themes in some of the compositions.</p>

            <img src="/a1/a1_w3.png" alt="class 2-2" style="width: 49%;">
            <img src="/a1/a1_w4.png" alt="class 2-3" style="width: 49%;">
            <img src="/a1/a1_w5.png" alt="class 2-4" style="width: 49%;">
            <img src="/a1/a1_w6.png" alt="class 2-5" style="width: 49%;">
            <p>Feedback: Those album covers are drawing the attention away from the main message of the poster, which is the sentence.</p>

            <hr color="black" style="margin-left:87vh">

            <h4>Class 4</h4>
            <p>I removed the album covers as suggested. Then, I decided to return to basics and make use of the layout of Spotify. I have created multiple layouts that are more simple.</p>
            <img src="/a1/a1_w7.png" alt="class 3" style="width: 49%;">
            <p>Feedback: Add more songs to increase the length of the sentence</p>

            <hr color="black" style="margin-left:87vh">

            <h4>Class 6</h4>
            <p>I added more song names to the sentence: Hi everyone! I’m in my second year of Graphic Design, one fun fact about me is that I don’t even know where my school at. This allowed me to fill in more space of the poster using the sentence. Lastly, I have made a few variations of the final piece with small differences.</p>
