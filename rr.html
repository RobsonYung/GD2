            <h5>1. The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of open-source tech). Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. What connections can you draw between these two articles? Do they prescribe solutions that are pertinent to each other? </h5>
            <p>Both of the authors agree that open-source tech brings a positive impact on the industry. When the designers have little or no knowledge of the technology that supports the machines and software, their only choice is to keep using the most popular design tool which is Adobe. Hence, it would limit the diversity of the work created to an extent. The only solution for this problem seems to be open-source tech, according to both of the authors. The slogan “with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow,” suggests that open-tech provides opportunities for software to improve with the help of programmers around the world. Although they did not prescribe any specific solutions, developing the scale open-source tech would be the first step to solve the solution.</p>
    
            <h5>2. Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?</h5>
            <p>In my opinion, thinking outside the box is one of the integral skills for a graphic designer. While nearly every designer is using the same design tools, you will have to think outside the box in order to create something outstanding and unique. When everyone is using the same tool, how to use it differently and in a more effective way becomes significant.</p>

        <h5>1. What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and provide at least 1 example. </h5>
        <p>In her article, Lialina suggested that universal users are those who can complete their tasks using software that was not purposely designed for that particular task. I think that everyone has the potential to become a universal user. With training and practice, people can develop a more flexible mindset which is the feature of universal users, and make life easier. It is a skill that can help us work in a more creative and efficient way. This is also related to Schwulst’s point too. Schwulst thinks that those popular platforms limited the possibility of what a website can do, especially when they focus more on advertising than their users’ needs. She mentioned that her favorite aspect of websites is their duality which means a website should have endless possible ways to work with. And universal users are the users that have the ability to achieve it. For example, Schwulst says that a website is a room, and "you can shift its contents or even include a temporary partition, depending on occasion" (Schwulst, 2018). The one who can do this is the universal users mentioned in Lialina's article. Hence, we can see that they are complementary to each other.</p>

        <h5>2. What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online (à la Schwulst).</h5>
        <p>I think that I am the opposite of a universal user, at least for now. I usually use the program for what it is purposely designed for. I used to consider it as a respectful act to the designers as this is their intention: to help the users achieve a particular task using their design. Lialina describes universal users as: "Such users will find a way to their aspiration without an app or utility programmed specifically for it" (Lialina, 2012) I may not try to search for a new app that is specifically for my goal but if I already know one, I would use it. It is just like that if I am going to play basketball, I would bring a pair of basketball shoes with me if I have one, but I would choose to wear other shoes if I don't have one. In the meantime, I wouldn't wear the basketball shoes to do other activities as they are specifically designed for playing basketball. Hence, I seldom use a website or software for a purpose that it's not supposed to serve.</p>

        <a href="https://www.typotheque.com/articles/the_importance_of_play" target="_blank"><h4>The Importance of Play</h4></a>

        <h5>1. A key part to generative design and code is pattern and routine. Akin to a chess player, marking each move down, and keeping a trace of your decisions can prove useful for your own process and future making. As a designer, to know that there might be a variety of possibilities to a given situation, can aid our ways of observing by using tools in novel ways. In one series of work, Van Rossum looks to fundamentals of waveforms as a departure point and reference point for connecting an interface to affecting the parameters of a letterform. If the letters explode, so too would the speakers. Find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature, that appears to be programmatic. Post a visual of this pattern and describe how it is programmatic in nature. </h5>
        <p>One example of a pattern in nature that I can think of is lightning and thunder. What would you do if you saw a flash of light in the sky? Most of us would probably cover our ears, especially when we were kids. The reason we do that is just like what Lightning McQueen says in Cars (2006), "Thunder always comes after Lightning." Even when we were kids, we have realized that lightning and thunder come together and it is always seeing the lightning first, then hearing the thunder. Scientifically, a huge spark is created when a static charge produces enough voltage in a thunderstorm. Lightning is the flash of the spark, while thunder is the sound of it hitting the ground. Since light travels faster than a sound wave, we always see the flash of light right before hearing the loud thunder. This creates a programmatic pattern between lightning and thunder where they always come in a certain order. Besides, there is also an interesting relationship between the lightness of the lightning and the loudness of the thunder. As we all know, the brighter the lightning, the louder the thunder, and the shorter the duration between them. This indicates that the lightning was pretty close to your position. </p>
